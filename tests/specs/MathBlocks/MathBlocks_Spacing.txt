## Math rendering

We support code blocks with the "math" type!

```math
G_{\mu v} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu v}
```

We also support math blocks and inline math blocks as well!

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

You can even typeset individual letters or whole sentences inline just like $x$
or $Quadratic \; formula$. You can also use math blocks to typeset whole
equations with $\LaTeX$:

$$ \begin{aligned} \dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\ \dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy \end{aligned} $$
